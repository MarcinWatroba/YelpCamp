<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
This application is still a work in progress, it will be improved with time as I improve my skills as a web developer.

<h2>Description</h2>
YelpCamp is a node.js web application designed by Colt Steele for an Udemy course called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=WebDevelopment_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.UK_ti.8322&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_73899898953_._ad_375956900774_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_aud-632926098907:dsa-774930035449_._li_1006543_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhdTqBRDNARIsABsOl99fRkj9hvevminwvxnMW0eBxTO6e12Fz9N7FpcaKHdXAJSl9NpoKYgaAkrVEALw_wcB">"The Web Developer Bootcamp"</a>.
This is my attempt at building the YelpCamp web app, where I use all the skills and technologies that I learned during this course.

<h2>Current Functionality</h2>
Current version of the app allows to register a new account with encrypted password, login, and logout.
Logged in users are able to add new camp entries that consist of camp name, image, price, and description.
Logged in users can also add comments to existing campgrounds, furthermore, all campgrounds and comments can be edited/deleted by the user who posted them.
All comments and campground posts have their "submitted date" saved and displayed in the form of time passed since submitted.
